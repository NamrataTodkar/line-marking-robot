# line-marking-robot
An Arduino-based autonomous robot for marking sports fields. Inspired by commercial robots like Turf Tank, it uses motors and a servo system to draw ground boundaries for games like football or athletics. This DIY version offers a low-cost solution for automating sports ground layout marking.
# Line Marking Robot 🏟️🖊️

This project is a **Line Marking Robot** designed to assist in automating the marking of lines on sports grounds such as football fields, athletic tracks, and other playing areas. It replaces traditional manual methods with a motorized robot controlled using an Arduino Nano.

## 🚀 Features

- Automates the marking of sports grounds
- Compact and lightweight design
- Controlled using an Arduino Nano and basic motor logic
- Marker or spray can attachment for drawing lines

## 🧰 Hardware Components

- Arduino Nano
- Motor Driver (L298N)
- 2× DC Motors with wheels
- Power supply (e.g., Li-ion battery)
- Marker or spray can holder
- Chassis and mechanical body

## 🧠 Software & Tools

- Arduino IDE
- Programming Language: **C**
- Serial Monitor (for basic debugging and testing)

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The robot is powered on and controlled using the Arduino Nano.
2. Motors are driven using a motor driver to move the robot forward.
3. A mounted marker or spray can draws lines as the robot moves across the sports ground.
4. The robot's path is manually aligned before marking begins.
